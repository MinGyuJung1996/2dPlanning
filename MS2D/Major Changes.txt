1. osculating circle part in RFB was deleted.
	tag oscrfb

2. endpoint return in findMax

3. g1 incontinuity is concerned in findMax
	tag g1inc

4. draw2() of circularArc added
	use theta now.

5. void MinkowskiSum() : collision detection part : can now use circularArc_models instead of bezier_models 

6. fixed bug on MinkowskiSum : "void overlapTest(std::vector<ArcSpline> &source, ArcSpline & lhs, ArcSpline & rhs)"
	=> case 5 was not evaluated correctly
